* Various mood changes such as anxiety, depression, mood swings, sleep disturbances, irritability, anger, and suicidal ideas are reported as part of Prodromal Schizophrenia symptoms. 

* Research shows that schizophrenia patients don't register subtle changes in reoccurring sounds as well as others and that this deficit can be measured by recording patterns of electrical brain activity obtained through electroencephalography (EEG).One of the many challenges we encounter working with EEG data is to understand the behavior of the participants while we were recording their brain activity. While their neural activity is definitely interesting, it is also equally important to know some simple metrics about their behavior, such as reaction time, accuracy, etc. 

* In order to analysis this experimental data, i have written functions that takes in account various logfiles of the participants and generate a summary performance statistics report which include target's reaction times to the inputs, number of hits, number of false alarm, number of misses and determine if participants are getting better over course of experiment.
